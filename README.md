# RedditBot

UC Berkeley hackathon for CS61A students. 

RedditBot traverse through all recent Reddit posts and parses through to check for harmful content. Redditbot down votes the userâ€™s post and displays the biggest offender. 

I learned how to connect to APIs, create a set of weighted stop words, visualize the results, and automate downvotes >:D
